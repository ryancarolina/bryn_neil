# Bryn Neil Java Challenge

Hello and thank you for taking the time to complete this quick challenge!

Challenge instructions:
Please complete the Java problems below by writing a solution in Java and then submitting your solutions by creating a pull request to this repo. Please note that all of the solutions must fully compile, be executeable, and contain at least one junit test.

Challenge 0 "Find the duplicate string":
Use the following array in your solution; String[]{"java", "spring", "coffee", "java", "cup"};

Write a solution using sets, create two sets and place duplicate strings in one set and non-duplicate strings in the other set. Print out the contents of each set to the console, please provide a concatenated string in your console message that lables each set with what it contains. For example; "Dupe set: value, value, value" "Non dupe set: value, value, value".


Challenge 1 "Count the transitions"

Use the following array in your solution; Integer[]{0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3};

Write a solution that will count the total number of transitions from one int to the next in the array provided above. Within your test please provide an assertion that compares your expected number of transitions VS the actual number of transitions. Please provide one true test case and one false test case.


Challenge 2 "Lists of lists"

Write a solution that contains a list of lists, then create n number of lists (at least 3) and append those lists to your list of lists. Finally, print to the console every other index of your list of lists. One of your lists must contain strings, one must contain longs, and one must contain floats. Each of your lists must have at least 6 indices.
